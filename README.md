# json-references

**This project is going smarter, and changing name! This repository is now deprecated. Go to its new home: [smart-circular](https://github.com/Keenpoint/smart-circular).**


Simplify JS objects, replacing **circular** references by the *path* leading to the parent reference. Useful before a JSON.stringify() or a recursive navigation over the object.
